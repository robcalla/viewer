	<span lang="en-GB">The Digital Enabler is an
					Internet of Everything platform that has two primary objectives,
					which in their complementarity, put into practice a holistic vision
					of smart city and urban-scale innovation. Such objectives are: i)
					to provide a data-driven, open, standard-oriented, user-centric,
					privacy-preserving and service-based platform for European smart
					cities, providing all the necessary technological elements for
					enabling city-scale co-creation and experimentation/deployment of
					IoE services and applications; ii) to support long-term
					sustainability of the platform by guaranteeing re-use and
					portability of urban IoE services and applications through no city
					lock-in and no vendor lock-in, and by defining a systemic and
					multi-domain approach to urban innovation in which every actor of
					the community (city manager, data provider, citizen, business,
					developer, ...) has a clear benefit.</span>
